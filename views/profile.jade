        h2 Learning to Program
        p I fell into website development after deciding that studying business studies for the next 3 years just wasn't for me. I liked the challenge it bought and the tools it gave to create and build with the potential of reaching a lot of people. Now in my final year, I have started to learn javascript, I have been building this site with node.js, and so far so good!
